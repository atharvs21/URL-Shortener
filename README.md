# URL-Shortener

A simple URL shortener was created using Python and its libraries. In this project, only two libraries written in Python are utilised: 
1. pyshorteners
2. tkinter

The given url is converted using "Pyshortener" into a shorter version, and "tkinter" is used to create and control a window so that the user is able to use the tool with ease.

To utilise the tool, the user must download and run the main python file that contains everything on his or her device.

I hope the tool is helpful.
Thanks!
